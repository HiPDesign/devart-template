## Description

Essentially we are creating an algorithm which will break down the data for each of these categories.  Combining a specified amount of images and profile searches (20:10).  These resulting images will be joined to create a combination of all the data received.  Creating, our very own data driven “being”. 

Each ‘being’ exists as the physical representation of the amalgamation of each packet of data taken from the API source points, ultimately funneled and stratified into tangible and physical three-dimensional displayed via LCD screen.

Based on present calculations, if the exhibit is open 12 hours a day, and we create one digital “being” per every 2 hours, and each “being” representing each of the 193 members of the United Nations, we will then represent all public online data signatures of each nation within 32 days.
